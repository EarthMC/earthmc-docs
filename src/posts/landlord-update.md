Hey everyone, Greed here. It's time for a new update! Here's what's new:


## Quarters Plugin
Fruitloopins, our in-house Developer, has created a plugin that allows you to create and sell apartments within your town. There are also some plot types other than apartments listed in the plugin's documentation, but keep in mind that the shop type is currently non-functional on EarthMC. You can however set the underlying Towny plot as a shop type and the quarter owner will be able to create a shop within the quarter regardless of the quarter's type.

### Using Quarters
In the plugin, Players can use a wand (flint) or a series of user-friendly commands to subdivide their town into 3D areas. The advantage this provides over stock Towny is not being limited by the perms applying to an entire town block, you can give players permissions to much more specific areas and stop wasting your land.

### Documentation
Look at the documentation for the plugin on the [Wiki](https://wiki.earthmc.net/Quarters).

### Credits
Lastly, another special thanks to Fruitloopins and all of the contributors of the plugin for making it possible. For those interested in supporting future plugin development, be sure to sponsor Fruitloopins [here](https://github.com/sponsors/Fruitloopins). Also be sure to report any bugs or issues you find to staff so they can be resolved.

## New Towny Changes
Alongside the Quarters plugin, we have also brought a variety of changes to the Towny plugin.

### Title/Surnames Length
Get a fancy new Nation title and/or surname with our increased character limit (10 to 16).

### Realtor
Extra town ranks have been added, such as Realtor. It can set plots for sale in a town that are not currently owned, take them off of sale and even set them as embassies. It compliments the Recruiter rank nicely to let trusted citizens get new players integrated into their town. It has all /plot permissions for unowned plots within towns. It also has permissions in Quarters to evict, sell, colour, change type, and toggle embassy.

### Settler
Remove liability to claim land yourself by designating a Settler. It has the permission to claim chunks for the town. 

### New Wildsblock
Share your town's resources with your residents by using our newly reformed wilds plot type. In plots designated as wilds `/plot set wilds`, residents in your town can now break stone, minerals (andesite, granite, diorite), ores, deepslate ores, and more. Mayors can essentially create mines within their towns and not have to worry about players destroying aesthetic structures at the surface. This allows for better looking mines and for resources underneath towns to be mined up.
