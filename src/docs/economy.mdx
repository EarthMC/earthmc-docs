# Economy
The currency on EarthMC is based on [gold ingots](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Ingot). 1 gold ingot is 1 unit of currency. The EarthMC economy is inflation resistant with efficient [gold sinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink). Gold is always in high demand which in turn creates a great gameplay experience and market environment. The large majority of items and services sold are provided by the players.

## Store your gold
The safest place for gold is in an ender chest. Gold can also be deposited into the virtual town/nation bank. This will allow residents with appropriate permissions to withdraw gold and use it for town/nation expenses such as claiming. To deposit, run `/t deposit <amount>` or `/n deposit <amount>`. With withdraw, run `/t withdraw <amount>` or `/n withdraw <amount>`.


## How to get gold
### Mining
The item-based currency allow players to dig it up straight from the ground. Gold ore is spread evenly across the world. Gold is equally frequent between Y0 to Y-64. 

### Raiding
All town protections are removed when a town falls. Find abandoned towns and loot the riches. Stealing is allowed.

### Voting
Run the command `/vote` and click the two links provided to you. You will receive a gold crate for each site you successfully submit a vote to. Currently, you can receive up to two gold crates per 24-hour day cycle. You can receive up to 64 gold or a special item reward on each gold crate you earn. Keep in mind that you are able to vote without being online but that you will not receive any reward.

### Shops
Open a shop and sell items to other players. The only thing you need is sufficent stock of the item you are trying to sell, competitive pricing, and a good location. Left-click a chest with the item you want to sell and follow the instructions. The most successful shops are built in nation capitals, nation capitals have the benefit of attracting a lot of customers through the nation spawn. The shopping districts of capitals are usually one of the main sources of income for nations and players alike. <br /> To learn more about shops, check out the [shops](/shops) page.

### Stock exchanges
While stock exchanges are not officially supported, players have been able to replicate real-life exchanges and make gold from them. Limited pieces of signed paper represent the stocks and can be traded and bought. Stock exchanges are not recommended for newcomers.
