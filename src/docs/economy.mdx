# Economy
The currency on EarthMC is based on [gold ingots](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Ingot). 1 gold ingot is 1 unit of currency. The EarthMC economy is inflation resistant with efficient [gold sinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink). Gold is always in high demand which in turn creates a great gameplay experience and market environment. The large majority of items and services sold are provided by the players.

## Store your gold
The safest place for gold is in an ender chest. Gold can also be deposited into the virtual town/nation bank. This will allow residents with appropriate permissions to withdraw gold and use it for town/nation expenses such as claiming. To deposit, run `/t deposit` or `/n deposit`. With withdraw, run `/t withdraw` or `/n withdraw`. 


## How to get gold
### Mining
The beauty of an item-based currency is that players can dig it up straight from the ground. Most players prefer to mine around y level 22. Although gold is evenly spread out around the map, some areas are more dugout than others. Avoid Europe and North America if you are a new player starting out.

### Raiding
All town protections are removed when a town falls. Find abandoned towns and loot the riches. Stealing is allowed on EarthMC.

### Voting
Run the command `/vote` and click the provided links. You will receive a gold crate with a random award of up to 64 gold ingots after successfully voting for the server. Keep in mind that you are able to vote without being online. Your award will be given to you next time you sign in and can be claimed with `/cr claim`. The most likely award is 4 gold per vote link. It's also possible to win tridents and mending enchantment books from voting, but they are very rare.

### Shops
Open a shop and sell items to other players. The only thing you need is stock, competitive pricing, and a good location. Hit a chest with the item you want to sell and follow the instructions. It's a straightforward process and should only take a few seconds to set up. The most successful shops are built in capitals. Capitals have the benefit of attracting a lot of customers through /n spawn. The shopping districts of capitals are usually one of the main sources of income for nations and players alike. 

### Collecting taxes
Mayors can collect taxes from residents with `/t set tax`, and nation kings can collect taxes from towns `/n set tax`. Taxes are collected once every 24 real-life hours. A message in the chat is sent when taxes are collected. Tax is a great tool to expand an empire and fund public infrastructure. One thing to look out for is not to set taxes too high. If a resident or town can't pay, they will be kicked from the town/nation. Taxes are not commonly used for this reason.

### Stock exchanges
While stock exchanges are not officially supported, players have been able to replicate real-life exchanges and make gold from them. Limited pieces of signed paper represent the stocks and can be traded and bought. Stock exchanges are not recommended for newcomers.
