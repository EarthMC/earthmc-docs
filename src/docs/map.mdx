# Map documentation 
After joining the server, the first thing you need to do is find out where you spawned. Visit the live map [earthmc.net/map/aurora](https://earthmc.net/map/aurora/). Scroll to zoom in.

The map is regularly updated to reflect changes made inside the game. The map shows:

* All visible online players.
* Changes made to the terrain.
* Claimed land belonging to nations and towns.
* Nation capitals are represented by a star symbol.

Players underground, sneaking, or using invisibility potions are hidden from the map. 

The colorful squares represent claimed land belonging to a town or nation. Click a claim of your choice to get more information about which town/nation it belongs to. Players with [premium](https://earthmc.net/premium/) can change their nation claim color with `/emcmap nationcolorâ”‚nationoutline`. Blue is the default claim color.

:::tip

Location coordinates displayed in the map's top left corner correspond with in-game coordinates displayed by pressing the F3 key. This information can be used to navigate in-game.
