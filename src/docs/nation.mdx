# Nation guide

![town](/img/nation.webp)

## Create a nation

Creating a new nation costs 2048 gold on Aurora and 1024 gold on Terra Nova.
Make sure you have deposited the required amount to the town's bank via
`/t deposit <amount>`. Only the mayor of a town can create a nation. The mayor's
town will become the nation capital. Create the nation with `/n new <name>`.

:::caution

Make sure your nation's name complies with the nation naming rules in rule 2.1
[rules](https://earthmc.net/docs/rules).

## Nation basics

As a nation leader, you can add allies with `/n ally add <nation>` and invite
towns to your nation with `/n add <town>`. Do note that a town needs to be
within a radius of 3500 blocks from your capital's home plot to be eligible for
invitation.

Give and remove ranks from residents of your nation with
`/n rank add <player> <rank>` or `/n rank remove <player> <rank>`. You can also
kick towns from the nation with `/n kick <town>`, delete the nation with
`/n delete`, toggle public joining to your nation with `/n toggle open`, and set
the nation's spawn location anywhere within your capital with `/n set spawn`.

Due to nations starting with no allies, you will likely want to get a lot as
quickly as you can as you require them to travel anywhere with the `/n spawn`
command. An efficient way to do so is by regularly checking `/res list`, and
running the `/res` command on all nation kings as marked by a yellow name, then
do `/t <name>` for the town listed in their `/res` and send an ally request to
them.

As your nation gains more citizens, your ranking on `/n list` will increase.
Nations fight each other to be on the top of this list as it shows who has put
the most time into recruiting towns and players, which is a good indicator of
activity. Nations (as well as towns) can also compete in a few categories. These
leaderboards can be seen via `/nation (or /town) list by category` (categories
should be automatically shown to the command sender).

## Nation ranks

Nation kings can give nation residents ranks with `/n rank add <player> <rank>`.

- **Chancellor** allows the player to do everything a king can do, except of:
  deleting the nation, setting the capital and setting the king. This is a
  dangerous rank to give as a player! The unwanted individual could remove
  allies or kick every town from your nation.
- **Colonists** may invite towns to the nation.
- **Diplomats** are able to send, accept and deny nation ally requests.

## Nation commands

:::note

Only Kings of the nation can run all of these commands. Chancellors are not
allowed to run `/n set king` and `/n delete`.
