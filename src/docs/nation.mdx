# Nation guide

![town](/img/nation.webp)

## Create a nation
Creating a new nation costs 1024 gold on Terra Nova and 2048 gold on Terra Aurora. Make sure you deposited the required amount in town's bank via `/t deposit <amount>`. Only a mayor of a town can create a nation. The mayor's town will become the nation capital. Create the nation with `/n new <name>`.

:::caution

Make sure your nation's name complies with the nation naming [rules](https://earthmc.net/docs/rules).

## Nation basics
As a nation leader, you can add allies with `/n ally add <nation>` and invite towns to your nation with `/n add <town>`. Do note that a town needs to be within a radius of 3500 blocks from your capital's home plot to be eligible for invitation.

Give and remove ranks from residents of your nation with `/n rank add <player> <rank>` or `/n rank remove <player> <rank>`. You can also kick towns from the nation with `/n kick <town>`, delete the nation with `/n delete`, toggle public joining to your nation with `/n toggle open`, and set the nation's spawn location anywhere within your capital with `/n set spawn`.

Due to nations starting with no allies, you will likely want to get a lot as quickly as you can as you require them to travel anywhere with the `/n spawn` command. An efficient way to do so is by regularly checking `/res list`, and running the `/res` command on all nation kings as marked by a yellow name, then do `/t <name>` for the town listed in their `/res` and send an ally request to them.

As your nation gains more citizens, your ranking on `/n list` will increase. Nations fight each other to be on the top of this list as it shows who has put the most time into recruiting towns and players, which is a good indicator of activity. Nations (as well as towns) can also compete in a few categories. These leaderboards can be seen via `/nation (or /town) list by category` (categories should be automatically shown to the command sender).

## Nation ranks
Nation kings can give nation residents ranks with `/n rank add <player> <rank>`.

* **Chancellor** allows the player to do everything a king can do, except of: deleting the nation, setting the capital and setting the king. This is a dangerous rank to give as a player! The unwanted individual could remove allies or kick every town from your nation.
* **Colonists** may invite towns to the nation.
* **Royal-treasurers** can not only deposit, but also withdraw gold from the national bank.
* **Diplomats** are able to send, accept and deny nation ally requests.

## Nation commands
:::note

Only king and nation residents with appropriate ranks can run nation commands.
