### Troubleshooting
If you have trouble joining the server, please make sure that:

* You join using Minecraft Java Edition. Bedrock Edition is **not** supported.
* You have a real Minecraft account purchased from [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net).
* You have a stable network connection.
* Mojang authentication services are available. 

Still can't join? [Try to change DNS servers to 1.1.1.1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup-1.1.1.1/windows) (Cloudflare) or 8.8.8.8 (Google). We have noticed that some players using DNS servers provided by their ISP sometimes have difficulties joining the server.
