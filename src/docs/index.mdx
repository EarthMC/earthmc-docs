## Why you might like it here
* The community - Community is ranked as the most liked aspect according to player surveys.
* The original - EarthMC is the first and largest Minecraft earth server.
* The map - Highly detailed and custom-made earth map.
* Longevity - EarthMC has been around since 2016. We run the same map for years. There has been a total of two map resets, one in 2018 and the last one in 2022.
* Server economy - Minecraft gold ingots are used as currency. The economy is inflation resistant with gold taken out of the economy at a similar rate of gold entering the economy. The economy is run by players, there are no admin shops.
* Expansive history - The rich server history is constantly being recorded on the [wiki](https://wiki.earthmc.net/).
* Fair monetization - EarthMC is funded through Premium, a rank that gives players convenient features and cosmetics. It is however not possible to buy progress.
* Easy to get started, difficult to master.

## Honest list of drawbacks
* The server is hosted in Europe. Players far away might experience high latency.
* The map can become static in popular areas of the map. It will be difficult to claim land at these locations.
* There are no "traditional" wars. It's unsustainable tying gameplay progress to PVP, as it's easy to gain unfair PVP leverage through cheat clients. This is why there isn't a war feature already. Conflicts are usually settled through diplomacy. A war system might be introduced in the future. 
* Server [TPS](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tick) might be under desired value (20) for extended periods of time. About 200 players are spread out on one server instance resulting in degraded performance due to the single-core nature of Minecraft. We have introduced several custom server-made patches to accommodate for this, but sometimes it's not enough. We are actively working towards introducing [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia) support which will improve performance in the future.
