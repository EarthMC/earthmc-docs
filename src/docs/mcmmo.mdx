# mcMMO
mcMMO allows players to level up skills such as mining, woodcutting, and fishing to get special abilities that help to make these tasks easier. The system is very similar to leveling in the game RuneScape.

## Skills and abilities
You can learn details on every skill and ability by using `/skillname ? pagenumber`. You can type `/skillname` i.e. `/mining`, `/woodcutting`, etc., to see your level and unlocked abilities in a particular skill.

To use a skill’s special ability, you must first unlock it by leveling up the skill and then right-click with the tool used for said skill to ready it, hit the block the tool is meant to break to activate it. An example of this is pressing right-click with a pickaxe and then breaking stone to activate your super breaker ability. Keep in mind that if you have an item in your offhand, you must crouch and right-click to ready your tool.

Some skills only have passive abilities. For example, leveling fishing reduces your time spent waiting for a catch, increases the rarity of items caught, and makes eating fish more effective. Leveling your alchemy skill will allow you to create more types of potions such as haste, absorption, and decay and will decrease the time it takes for you to make potions.
