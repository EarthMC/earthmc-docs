Quarters extends the functionality of towns and plots to allow the creation of apartments. Standard [plots](https://earthmc.net/docs/town#plots) are restricted to a simple grid-based system that requires allowing and restricting permissions of an entire chunk. Quarters can instead create dynamically sized cuboids in which permissions can be edited.

## Creating a quarter

To create a quarter you need to be the mayor or councillor, then you can select two positions using a flint item. With two positions selected an outline of a cuboid will appear showing your selection while you are holding the wand item. To proceed type `/q selection add`, if you would like to add more cuboids to your selection repeat selecting two positions and adding them with the same command.

:::tip

If you cannot get access to a flint you can use `/q pos1` and `/q pos2` to select at your feet.

:::

With your cuboids selected run the command `/q create`, if you have the necessary permissions this will turn all your selected cuboids into a quarter. These cuboids will all share a particle outline and permissions.

Remain aware that any cuboids added will be validated before creation to ensure that they are in a valid location. If you are having issues with creating a new quarter check the below:

- The quarter is entirely within a single town
- There is no wilderness within any of the cuboid's bounds
- Your selected cuboids do not overlap with any pre-existing cuboids

## Permission management

As opposed to [plots](https://earthmc.net/docs/town#plots), you can *not* change individual build/destroy/switch/item per quarter. Instead, you can chose to trust or not trust other players with full access to the quarter. Commands `/q trust add` or `/q trust remove` is used to manage who to trust with the quarter. Furthermore, you may change quarter type which also change what type of permissions players in the quarter have. Read more about plot types below.

:::warning

Quarter permissions override the underlying plot permissions where applicable. Plot build/destroy/switch/item permissions still apply to the quarter.

## Quarter types

All quarter types are additive to the functionality of the default apartment type, below is a short description of the others.

| Quarter Type | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Apartment    | The default quarter type, the quarter owner can set trusted users. The owner, trusted users, and those with permissions in the underlying towny plot can alter this quarter type. All other quarter types inherit and add to the appartment type. |
| Commons      | Permits any resident in the quarter's town to use switches and items within its bounds. Extendable to all players as an embassy.                               |
| Shop         | Allows for the creation of shops, regardless of the underlying plot's shop status.                                                                            |
| Station      | Enables residents of the quarter's town to place, use, and destroy boats and minecarts within its bounds. Extendable to all players.                          |


## Sell or buy quarters

To sell a quarter stand within its bounds and type `/q sell {price}`, a player can then purchase it using `/q claim` while standing inside it. You must first turn the quarter into an embassy using `/q toggle embassy` to sell to a player who is not a resident of the quarter's town. If the quarter's embassy status is removed the non-resident owner's ownership will be revoked.


## Commands

:::tip Premium colour feature

Players with [Premium](https://earthmc.net/docs/premium) can change quarter particle outline colour with `/q colour {r} {g} {b}`. RGB takes in three int values between 0-255.
