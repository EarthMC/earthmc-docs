## Channels
The chat is divided into channels, and you decide which ones to display. All channels you have permission to view are active by default. Check which channels you are currently in with the command `/ch list`. Leave the channels you do not wish to participate in with `/ch leave <channel>`. To write in a specific channel, for example town chat, run `/ch join town`. The default write channel is `global`. Stick to English when writing in global chat so everyone can understand.

## Private messaging
Send a private message with `/msg <player> <message>`. Quickly reply to last private message with `/r <message>`. Send mail to offline players with `/mail send <player> <message>`. You can read mails via `/mail read`.

## Ignoring players
Sometimes a single player ruins chat. Instead of leaving the channel, you can ignore the individual player with `/ignore <player>`. All messages from the ignored player will be hidden until you `/unignore <player>`.
