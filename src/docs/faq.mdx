# Frequently asked questions

### Will you transfer data from an account to another account of mine?
No, sorry. We never transfer data or ranks between player accounts. This is mainly a question of security. The only way we can verify your identity is through your Minecraft account. Contact Mojang support if you have lost access to your account.

### How do I apply for helper? 
Apply by clicking [here](https://goo.gl/Ssc9U2). Good luck!

### Can I join EarthMC on Bedrock Edition?
This server only supports Minecraft Java Edition.

### Can I download the EarthMC map?
No, the map is not downloadable by players.

### I entered the wrong username/email on store checkout. What do I do?
Thanks for the purchase! We can fix that easily if you email `contact@earthmc.net` with your Minecraft username.

### What is EarthMC Classic?
EarthMC Classic is the first release of EarthMC. It has been officially closed in 2018 and now is in view-only mode.
