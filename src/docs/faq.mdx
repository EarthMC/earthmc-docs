# Frequently asked questions

### Will you transfer data from an account to another account of mine?
No, sorry. We never transfer data or ranks between player accounts. This is mainly a question of security. The only way we can verify your identity is through your Minecraft account. Contact Mojang support if you have lost access to your account.

### How do I apply for helper? 
Apply here. https://goo.gl/Ssc9U2. Good luck!

### Can I join EarthMC with bedrock edition?
No, sorry. This server only supports Minecraft Java edition.

### Can I download the EarthMC map?
No, the map is exclusive for EarthMC.

### I entered the wrong username/email on store checkout, what do I do?
Thanks for the purchase! We can fix that easily if you email contact@earthmc.net with your Minecraft username.

### What is EarthMC classic?
EarthMC classic is the first version of EarthMC no longer in use. Check out the dedicated [EarthMC classic wiki](https://earthmcclassic.fandom.com/wiki/EarthMC_Wiki) if you are interested in the server's early days.
