## Accessing the API

The API can be accessed through the URL `api.earthmc.net`. It provides data in JSON format, the endpoints are as follows:

### Server endpoint

* `/v2/aurora/`

The server endpoint provides some basic info about the server such as the number of online players or the amount of towns.

### Bulk endpoints

* `/v2/aurora/residents/`
* `/v2/aurora/townless/`
* `/v2/aurora/towns/`
* `/v2/aurora/nations/`

Bulk endpoints contain all of the objects of the specified type and all their associated data so you do not need to individually request all of them.

### Lookup endpoints

* `/v2/aurora/residents/{name}/`
* `/v2/aurora/towns/{name}/`
* `/v2/aurora/nations/{name}/`

Lookup endpoints provide info on one thing at a time, for instance a single player or town.

### List endpoints

* `/v2/aurora/lists/residents/`
* `/v2/aurora/lists/townless/`
* `/v2/aurora/lists/towns/`
* `/v2/aurora/lists/nations/`

List endpoints simply list the names of all the objects in the specified type, if you want their data you will need to individually look them up. It is recommended you use the above bulk endpoints if you need the data of everything.

## Changelog since /v1/

* Added "list endpoints" that just display the names of objects in case all you need is names, these are effectively the same as the old `https://api.earthmc.net/v1/aurora/{type}/` endpoints
* Moved the num{Residents/Towns/Nations} stats to `https://api.earthmc.net/v2/aurora/`
* `https://api.earthmc.net/v2/aurora/{type}/` now lists all the data of every object within the specified type, they are referred to as "bulk endpoints"
* List and bulk resident lookups have been split into "residents" and "townless", this is mainly intended to ease the amount of data sent if all you need is just players with towns
* Values are no longer present if they do not exist, i.e. not in a town = no town key
* Added numTownless, numOnlineTownless, and numTownBlocks stat to `https://api.earthmc.net/v2/aurora/`
* Player lookups now have an isNPC stat to easily filter out NPCs programmatically
* Town and nation lookups now have UUIDs
* Town and nation UUIDs can now be used in lookups

## Usage example

Print a list of all nations that a nation still needs to ally:
```py
import requests

nation = "Australia"

allNationsLookup = requests.get("https://api.earthmc.net/v2/aurora/lists/nations/").json()
nationsLookup = requests.get(f"https://api.earthmc.net/v2/aurora/nations/{nation}").json()

allyList = nationsLookup["allies"]
allNations = allNationsLookup
allNations.remove(nationsLookup["strings"]["nation"])

unalliedList = list(set(allNations).difference(set(allyList)))
print(unalliedList)
```
